            <b>"From childhood’s hour I have not been </b>
            <br>
            <strong>As others were—I have not seen </strong>
            <br>
            <i> As others saw—I could not bring</i> 
            <br>
            <em> My passions from a common spring— </em>
            <br>
            <mark>From the same source I have not taken</mark>
            <br>
            <small>My sorrow—I could not awaken</small>
            <br>
            <del>My heart to joy at the same tone—</del>
            <br>
            And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—
            <br>
            Then—in my childhood—in the dawn
            <br>
            Of a most stormy life—was drawn
            <br>
            From ev’ry depth of good and ill
            <br>
            The mystery which binds me still—
            <br>
            From the torrent, or the fountain—
            <br>
            From the red cliff of the mountain—
            <br>
            From the sun that ’round me roll’d
            <br>
            In its autumn tint of gold—
            <br>
            From the lightning in the sky
            <br>
            As it pass’d me flying by—
            <br>
            From the thunder, and the storm—
            <br>
            And the cloud that took the form
            <br>
            <ins>(When the rest of Heaven was blue)</ins>
            <br>
            Of a demon in my view— "<sub>  -Edgar Allan Poe</sub>
